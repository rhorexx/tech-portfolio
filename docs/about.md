Thank you for visiting my site!

I love finding patterns! Currently, I work in derivatives technology. I help to support Citi's fixed income trading processing system. Prior to this, I was in working in credit technology.
 
Before starting at Citi, I was at Binghamton University. Most notably, I was the CFO of the Student Association during my senior year. I strive to provide creative solutions to tackle today's complex problems. If you want to get in touch, go ahead and email me!
 
My goal is to never stop learning.

## A Day in My Life (Pre-COVID)
I wake up at 5:30 am. Every week day, I listen to The Daily podcast on my way to work. During the day, I read WSJ articles and work on issues with derivatives processing. On my way back from work, I like to listen to books on Audible.

On the weekends, I like to play video games with my friends. Every Sunday morning, my roommates and I prepare a week's worth of food for the upcoming week. I like to spend Sunday afternoon bullet journaling with my best friend.

Once a month, I visit my family on Long Island where we go for bike rides and play board games. During the winter months, I love to unplug from technology and take a short trip to a cabin with my boyfriend to relax for the weekend. Every other year, I like to take a trip another country. I am passionate about personal finance and continuous learning. 

## Favorite Things
Mac and cheese, tigers, finding nemo, collecting foreign coins/bills, minecraft, rnb music, fuzzy blankets, the color purple, ben and jerry's icecream, bob ross, and salt & vinegar chips.
